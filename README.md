## Abstract
From Assignment "Our Software Factory develops various software products, each one requiring a software build. A software  product  is  identified  by  its  name  and  version.    A  software  build  identifies  the components  needed  for  a  particular  product.  Components  may  be  shared  among  products.  The build  status  for  a  product  is  the  lowest  status  of  any  of  its  components.  Each  component  has  a status of ready, usable, and not-ready. Information required about each component includes size, programming  language  (such  as  C,  C++,  C#,  Java,  or  PHP),  component  name  and  3  character version. Each component has one person identified as its owner. People have a unique ID (5 digit number), name (60 characters) and seniority (newbie, junior, senior). Components get their status as a result of a software inspection (peer review). An inspection event covers one component and results  in  an  inspection  score  (0  ..  100).  If  the  score  is  greater  than  90,  the  component  is considered  “Ready”.    If  the  score  is  less  than  75,  it  is  “not-ready”;  otherwise  it  is  “usable”. Inspection  data  includes  what  was  inspected,  the  date  of  inspection,  who  conducted  the inspection, inspection score, and textual description. The textual description can be updated later, but the score can never be changed.  Components may be inspected multiple times but only once per day."

## What I need to do
1) Create tables (Done)
2) Create triggers for each requirement (Working on)
3) Make adjustments after given a list of application requirements
4) Test code
